Unfortunately there are some worksheets that I was unable to complete due to time constraints and current events(Covid - 19 2020)
These Worksheets are:
Worksheet 5 VM use and MatPlotLib - no exercises completed
Worksheet 7 - Exercises 3, 4, 5 and 6 not done
Worksheet 8 - Exercises 4, 5, 6 and 7 not done

I intend on completing these outside of the timeframe imposed on the course and will update repository when done.
I understand that future commits will not be counted towards the course grade.
Thanks Saul, its been a challenging but rewarding couple of months and although at points it was frustrating,
I feel that my understanding of python and programming in general has been greatly expanded.
Thanks.
Paul.
